# Traveling Salesman Problem â€“ Supervised Learning in JAX/FLAX

In this repository, we implement supervised learning for the TSP with 100 nodes, with
the BQ-NCO Transformer architecture. 

## Steps to do

- First, we build a PyTorch Dataloader that loads in the batches but collates them to numpy
- We write the Transformer module in NNX
- Training loop written in NNX
